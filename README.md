# Wine Shop & Delicatessen Customer Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior for a wine shop and delicatessen using survey data. The goal is to uncover actionable insights to help the store improve sales, better understand its customers, and optimize both wine and delicatessen product offerings.

## Data
- **Source:** Customer survey data (`data/Wine_Data.csv`)
- **Fields:** Wine consumption frequency, payment mode, place to drink, additional products purchased, gender, education, age, and ticket value

## Analysis Performed
The analysis (in `wine_analysis.py`) includes:
- Wine consumption patterns by age group
- Payment preferences by age
- Popular places to drink wine
- Average spending by venue
- Popular product pairings
- Product preferences by age (heatmap)
- Ticket value distribution
- Wine consumption frequency distribution
- Customer segmentation by spending
- Average spending by education level
- Product preferences by gender (100% stacked bar)


## How to Run the Analysis
1. Ensure you have Python 3 and the required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`).
2. Place the survey data in the `data/` folder as `Wine_Data.csv`.
3. Run `wine_analysis.py` to generate figures and print summary statistics.
4. Review the generated charts in the `figures/` folder for visual insights.
